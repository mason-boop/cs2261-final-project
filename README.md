# cs2261-final-project

This is my final project for CS 2261. It's made in C and is ran by running the "Project.gba" file.
It was inspired by/copied from the Cartoon Network minigame "BMO Dreamo".
Other than the title screen, all the art was drawn by me.
All files are present except for the sound files, which were too big to upload to GitHub.

To play: use ENTER key to start & pause, UP & DOWN arrows to move, and hold X to activate the cheat.
